# maestro automation

Deterministic and hierarchy-driven automation for Rabby Mobile.

This is the preferred local e2e path right now.

## Flow naming

- use `shared-*.yaml` only for flows that are confirmed reusable across platforms
- default to `android-*.yaml` / `ios-*.yaml` first when adding or changing flows
- keep the platform prefix for anything platform-specific, or anything that has only been validated on one platform so far
- merge back into `shared-*` only after both platform variants have been implemented, compared, and verified to have no meaningful divergence

Currently verified shared utilities:

- `flows/shared-dismiss-bottom-overlay.yaml`
- `flows/shared-dismiss-debug-warnings-overlay.yaml`

Current first flow:

- `flows/android-onboarding-import-private-key.yaml`
  - start from the welcome page
  - import via private key
  - set app password
  - explicitly turn biometrics off when the toggle is on
  - wait for single-address balance to render after success, then return to unlocked Home

- `flows/android-onboarding-import-private-key-to-single-home.yaml`
  - same onboarding path, but it intentionally stops on single-address Home
  - this is the base flow for single-address balance smoke validation

- `flows/ios-onboarding-import-private-key-to-single-home.yaml`
  - start from the welcome page on a booted iOS simulator
  - paste the first configured private key through the simulator system clipboard
  - use an iOS-specific submit point on the private-key page
  - enter the app password for real on `SetupWallet`
  - explicitly turn biometrics off when the toggle is on
  - stop on single-address Home after success

- `src/run-ios-onboarding-import-private-key.mjs`
  - require a booted iOS simulator
  - terminate the debug app, clear simulator app data, and reset the simulator keychain
  - write the first configured private key into the simulator pasteboard before launch
  - launch the app, then run the iOS onboarding flow end-to-end

- `flows/android-home-balance-smoke.yaml`
  - preserve app data and relaunch
  - bootstrap from Welcome, Unlock, or Home
  - wait until Home portfolio balance exits the loading state
  - on debug builds, validate Home state through the DevTools bridge
  - toggle the Home curve once and then restore it

- `src/run-android-single-home-balance-smoke.mjs`
  - clear app state and import the first configured private key
  - stop on single-address Home
  - on debug builds, validate balance / change / curve state through the DevTools bridge
  - toggle the single-address curve once and then restore it
  - return to unlocked Home at the end of the debug validation chain

- `src/run-android-balance-suite.mjs`
  - runs the current balance-focused debug regression chain in order
  - onboarding into single-address Home
  - relaunch and verify Home portfolio balance
  - add watch address and verify Home recovers afterward

- `src/run-android-components2024-showcase-smoke.mjs`
  - preserve app data and relaunch
  - bootstrap from Welcome, Unlock, or Home
  - navigate from Home into Settings -> UI Playground -> 2024 Components
  - verify a small set of stable `components2024` interactions through testIDs

- `src/run-android-send-smoke.mjs`
  - preserve app data and relaunch
  - require an already-configured wallet state instead of onboarding from scratch
  - bootstrap only from Lock screen, single-address Home, or multi-address Home
  - on debug builds, use the DevTools bridge to open the Send screen with a local fixture
  - inject the amount through the DevTools bridge, then use Maestro to submit the Send flow for real

Run:

```bash
cd apps/automation-maestro
cp .env.example .env.local
# fill RABBY_MAESTRO_TEST_PRIVATE_KEYS in .env.local
node src/run-android-onboarding-import-private-key.mjs
```

Or from the repo root:

```bash
yarn workspace automation-maestro run:android-onboarding-import-private-key
```

iOS simulator onboarding:

```bash
yarn workspace automation-maestro run:ios-onboarding-import-private-key
```

Home balance smoke:

```bash
yarn workspace automation-maestro run:android-home-balance-smoke
```

Single-address balance smoke:

```bash
yarn workspace automation-maestro run:android-single-home-balance-smoke
```

Balance suite:

```bash
yarn workspace automation-maestro run:android-balance-suite
```

Components2024 showcase smoke:

```bash
yarn workspace automation-maestro run:android-components2024-showcase-smoke
```

Send smoke:

```bash
yarn workspace automation-maestro run:android-send-smoke
```

Multi-key run:

- first key uses the onboarding flow above
- remaining keys reuse unlocked Home and import from the top-right add-address entry
- no extra app reset/relaunch between the remaining keys

```bash
yarn workspace automation-maestro run:android-onboarding-import-private-keys
```

## Runtime

- requires `node >= 22`
- the shell entrypoints are intentionally thin and delegate to the Node runners
- `RABBY_MAESTRO_TEST_PRIVATE_KEYS` is a `;`-separated list
- `RABBY_MAESTRO_APP_ID` is the Maestro `appId` for the current target
- `RABBY_MAESTRO_APP_PASSWORD` is the app unlock/setup password used by flows
- Maestro itself does not auto-read `.env*` here
- the Node runner loads local env files, resolves config, then passes values to
  `maestro test -e ...`
- the iOS onboarding runner additionally resets the booted simulator keychain,
  clears app data, and writes the first configured private key into the
  simulator pasteboard before launching the app
- debug-package runners additionally connect to Metro DevTools and write bridge snapshots as JSON artifacts next to the Maestro HTML reports
- local-only files such as `.env.local`, `.env.regression`, and `.artifacts/`
  are expected to stay untracked inside this package

Example:

```bash
RABBY_MAESTRO_TEST_PRIVATE_KEYS=0xabc...;0xdef...;0x123...
```

Compatibility:

- the single-key env `RABBY_MAESTRO_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY` still works
- the existing single-flow runner defaults to the first key in
  `RABBY_MAESTRO_TEST_PRIVATE_KEYS`
- legacy Android-prefixed envs such as `RABBY_ANDROID_E2E_PACKAGE`,
  `RABBY_ANDROID_APP_PASSWORD`, `RABBY_ANDROID_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY`, and
  `RABBY_ANDROID_TEST_PRIVATE_KEYS` still work as fallbacks

Env loading order:

1. inherited shell environment
2. `./.env`
3. `./.env.local`

Later files override earlier files. Inherited shell env wins over all local
files.

Profile-specific env:

- set `RABBY_MAESTRO_ENV=regression` to additionally load
  `./.env.regression` and `./.env.regression.local`
- profile files are loaded after the generic `.env*` files, so they can
  override package name, password, and test key settings cleanly

Artifacts:

- by default, reports are written to `apps/automation-maestro/.artifacts/`
- override the output root with `RABBY_MAESTRO_ARTIFACTS_DIR=...`

## Shared flow fixture

The automation runners can read a shared local JSON fixture so multiple flows
can keep their scenario inputs in one place.

Checked-in example:

- `apps/automation-maestro/flows.fixture.example.json`

Preferred local file:

- `apps/automation-maestro/flows.fixture.local.json`

Legacy Send-only fallback:

- `apps/automation-maestro/send.fixture.local.json`

Current Send smoke resolution order:

1. `RABBY_SEND_FIXTURE_FILE`
2. `RABBY_FLOW_FIXTURE_FILE`
3. `android.sendSmoke.fixtureFile` from `maestro.config.local.*`
4. `android.sharedFixtureFile` from `maestro.config.local.*`
5. `apps/automation-maestro/flows.fixture.local.json`
6. `apps/automation-maestro/send.fixture.local.json`

Example:

```json
{
  "send": {
    "from": {
      "address": "0x341a1fBD51825E5a107DB54cCb3166DeBA145479"
    },
    "to": {
      "address": "0x28E6A2021769102BbAB3730A2F70cDdce1bf3Db3"
    },
    "token": {
      "chain": "arb",
      "tokenId": "0xaf88d065e77c8cc2239327c5edb3a432268e5831",
      "symbol": "USDC"
    },
    "amount": "0.1"
  }
}
```

## Optional config file

If present, the runner auto-loads the first matching file:

- `maestro.config.local.mjs`
- `maestro.config.local.js`
- `maestro.config.local.cjs`
- `maestro.config.local.json`
- `maestro.config.mjs`
- `maestro.config.js`
- `maestro.config.cjs`
- `maestro.config.json`

You can also point to a specific file with `RABBY_MAESTRO_CONFIG=...`.

Example:

```js
export default {
  maestro: {
    binary: "/Users/you/.maestro/bin/maestro"
  },
  android: {
    sharedFixtureFile: "flows.fixture.local.json",
    onboardingImportPrivateKey: {
      packageName: "com.cubex.wallet.debug",
      appPassword: "11111111",
      launchActivity:
        "com.cubex.wallet.debug/com.cubex.wallet.MainActivity"
    },
    sendSmoke: {
      fixtureFile: "flows.fixture.local.json"
    },
    homeImportPrivateKey: {
      flowFile: "flows/android-home-import-private-key.yaml"
    }
  },
  ios: {
    onboardingImportPrivateKey: {
      bundleId: "com.cubex.wallet.debug",
      appPassword: "11111111",
      flowFile: "flows/ios-onboarding-import-private-key.yaml",
      resetKeychain: true,
      clearAppData: true
    }
  }
};
```
